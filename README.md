Implement and explore essential data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. They also work on key algorithms for sorting, searching, and traversing these structures.
Learning how to optimize and apply these data structures in real-world problem-solving cases, which is crucial for advanced software development.
